                                    toy is a <strong>small, simple, code oriented, modular</strong> c++ game engine.  
                                    <br><br>

                                    toy puts the emphasis on games made of <strong>simple, expressive native c++ code</strong> extended through <strong>tools, editors and scripting</strong>, to design full featured 2d or 3d games in <strong>fast iterations</strong>.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Focused on <strong>versatility</strong> at the core, it gives full control over its <strong>expressive rendering and user interface systems</strong>, making it suitable to build <strong>any kind of game</strong>.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Designed for <strong>quick iterations</strong> and experimentation, it is deeply <strong>hackable</strong>, entirely <strong>scriptable</strong>, and provides a <strong>fully programmable 3d renderer</strong>, giving you direct access to shaders, materials and render paths.
                                    <br><br>
                                    As a collection of game programming <strong>building blocks</strong>, it also aims to foster an ecosystem of simple minimal reusable components for everyone, and it is suited for <strong>building your own game technology</strong>.
                                    <br><br>
                                    On top of these fundamentals, toy adds plenty of game programming systems such as physics, a navigation system, procedural generation algorithms, many tools, and more.

                                </header>
                                <p class="content">
                                    toy puts <strong>native code</strong> at the forefront of the development of your game. toy is first and foremost meant to write games in native c++ code, directly, effortlessly, <strong>in direct contact with the fundamental systems</strong>. this ensures that toy is on the cutting edge, both in <strong>performance and versatility</strong>, and a fit for both big traditional development teams as well as single indie developers.
                                    <br><br>
                                    typical engines are often biased towards specific kinds of games (platformers, shooters). that bias is created by the tooling, and of the editor worflow. toy, by putting the emphasis on native code, and <strong>direct access to its powerful user interface and rendering systems</strong>, is designed from the start with unconventional or complex games in mind, such as real time strategy games or role playing games. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    toy will provide minimalist templates demonstrating how each type of game can be easily implemented. until then the primary source of information is the code of the examples, which illustrate how a game archetype is easily assembled by connecting the different systems.
                                    <br><br>
                                    this doesn't mean that toy doesn't include scripting: on the contrary, toy automatically extends both built-in systems, and user code through the reflection system, to ensure <strong>complete and seamless access of through both text scripts and visual scripts</strong>. if you want, toy gives you the ability to code your game <strong>completely in a scripting language</strong>.
                                </p>

                                    toy powerful reflection system automatically extends your game core code for <strong>seamless scripting, editing, inspection</strong> of your game objects, types and procedures in the built-in tools/editor. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    in toy, there is no such thing as a monolithic editor: tools are independent reusable blocks, using the expressive strength of the ui system, to provide user operations for specific components (for example, manipulating scene entities), or, using the power of reflection, operating in a generic manner on any object.
                                    <br><br>
                                    this approach is key to empowering development teams, by enabling them to <strong>design and use their own custom suite of editors</strong> tailored to the <strong>needs of the specific game they are working on</strong>. an editor, in that design, is simply a collection of tools bound together by an overarching user interface managing global state and credentials.
                                    <br><br>
                                    toy provides a range of tools, such as a <strong>scene outliner, a generic object inspector, a text script editor, a visual script editor</strong>, and others. a team that doesn't need any custom tools can just build the editor template provided by toy, which bundles together all those built-in tools in a nice sleek editor.
                                    <br><br>
                                    rather than try to provide too many built-in tools from the start, toy bets on an ecosystem of specialized tools growing progressively, thanks to a terribly simple and expressive user interface paradigm, and the clear and open outline of the engine core systems. first, the basics, then tools for animating, painting, assembling will naturally evolve.
